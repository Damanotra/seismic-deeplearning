## F3 Netherlands Patch Experiments
In this folder are training and testing scripts that work on the F3 Netherlands dataset. 
You can run five different models on this dataset:
* [HRNet](configs/hrnet.yaml)
* [SEResNet](configs/seresnet_unet.yaml)
* [UNet](configs/unet.yaml)
* [PatchDeconvNet](configs/patch_deconvnet.yaml)
* [PatchDeconvNet-Skip](configs/patch_deconvnet_skip.yaml)

All these models take 2D patches of the dataset as input and provide predictions for those patches. The patches need to be stitched together to form a whole inline or crossline.

To understand the configuration files and the dafault parameters refer to this [section in the top level README](../../../README.md#configuration-files)

### Setup

Please set up a conda environment following the instructions in the top-level [README.md](../../../README.md#setting-up-environment) file.
Also follow instructions for [downloading and preparing](../../../README.md#f3-Netherlands) the data.

### Running experiments

Now you're all set to run training and testing experiments on the F3 Netherlands dataset. Please start from the `train.sh` and `test.sh` scripts, which invoke the corresponding python scripts. If you have a multi-GPU machine, you can also train the model in a distributed fashion by running `train_distributed.sh`. Take a look at the project configurations in (e.g in `default.py`) for experiment options and modify if necessary. 

### Monitoring progress with TensorBoard
- from the this directory, run `tensorboard --logdir='output'` (all runtime logging information is
written to the `output` folder  
- open a web-browser and go to  either vmpublicip:6006 if running remotely or localhost:6006 if running locally  
> **NOTE**:If running remotely remember that the port must be open and accessible
